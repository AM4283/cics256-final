# cics256-final

This is code for a memory game like simon, where there is a sequence of buttons that light up that has to be repeated by the player. 
Each time the player gets the sequence correct the sequence gets incremented by one. The sequence starts at length 1 and goes until the player messes up.
Our twist to this classic game is that the player can choose whether to play with only sound, only LEDs, or both. 
For the only sound gamemode, a tone is played of a certain pitch which corresponds to a certain button instead of that button lighting up.
